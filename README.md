## About The Project

This was a challenge for BLITZ, the description of the challenge was as follows,

Exercise
The attached file (`discography.txt`) contains Bob Dylanâ€™s discography.
Our goal is to get a Trello board through interacting with the Trello API, with the albums
classified in lists sorted by decade. Each album should display its year and title and show up
in the list sorted by year, and in the case of the same year alphabetically. Additionally, we'd
like each album to have the cover art if we can fetch it from Spotify.
Your solution should be able to do that from the discography file.
